This test file checks the behavior of the MyList class and its print_sorted method.

Steps:
1. Create an instance of MyList.
2. Append the following integers to the list in this order: 1, 4, 2, 3, 5.
3. Print the list — should return the original unsorted list.
4. Call print_sorted() — should print the list sorted in ascending order.
5. Print the list again — should still show the original unsorted list (i.e., list is unchanged).

Expected output:
[TypeError] name must be an integer
[ValueError] age must be greater than 0
[ValueError] distance must be greater than 0
